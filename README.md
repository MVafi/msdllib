# MSDLlib

**Experimental**

A JavaScript library for parsing Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) data.
Currently MSDLlib only supports the most commonly used MSDL data structures.

The Military Scenario Definition Language is an XML-based language designed to support military
scenario development. MSDL, also known as [SISO-STD-007-2008](https://www.sisostds.org/DesktopModules/Bring2mind/DMX/Download.aspx?Command=Core_Download&EntryId=45690&PortalId=0&TabId=105), is a standard developed by the [Simulation Interoperability Standards
Organization (SISO)](https://www.sisostds.org/Home.aspx). For more information about MSDL please
visit the [SISO standards page](https://www.sisostds.org/productspublications/standards/sisostandards.aspx)
and [SISO Product data files page](https://www.sisostds.org/Schemas.aspx).

Please note that MSDL will be superseded by C2SIM-Initialize. You can read more about this on the
[C2SIM PDG/PSG page](https://www.sisostds.org/StandardsActivities/DevelopmentGroups/C2SIMPDGPSG-CommandandControlSystems.aspx).
